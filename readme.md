This should be considered a very early release. Just wanted to share the rough concept for now to guage interest and collect feedback. 

Things to do:

* Only load the plugin on the required post types and admin screens (filterable)
* Enable on the HTML editor too?
* Improve the design of the suggestions
* Parse the inline docs to discover and hint the shortcode attributes - would be nice if shortcodes made this clearer and there was a a standard approach
